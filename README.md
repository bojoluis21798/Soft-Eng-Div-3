## I made some changes (2/10 around 9PMish)
- Ok back end is essentially done we just need the modules people to do a few more things
- So there are some parts where I didn't put any alerts in so please take of those (ie during add an itme to menu, it will work but not prompt the user that it is done)
- Please also take care of the statuses in the client side (Imcomplete to complete or something)
- I also think we need to employ another library that can keep on requesting from the server so that if any changes are made, it will be directly reflected on the cashier side
-just tell me if you find any bugs and I'll do my best to help
-Good luck friends
