## I made some changes (2/9 around 5:10ish)
- made all of the files php (Even though I didn't have to)
- using AJAX (lol)
- added the DB file here (db name is customer so put that in your phpmyadmins)
- other backend guys do the C U D operations in Crud, all the operations are in one PHP file
- added not-so-secret password promt when clicking on little Zai's face in index.php
